# flutter_listview_builder

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

ListView.builder is used for different different items dynamically
same attributes as ListView

You need to use ListView  and its function builder,which returns a widget

There's also a function 'separated', which returns a widget(such as Divider) which separates. 
to do this you need to use an attribute 'separatedBuilder' which returns the widget which separates the other widgets.
